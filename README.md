That’s a great move 🚀 — with your background in **Elixir** and **Java**, you already have strong backend foundations, so you can skip the “baby steps” and learn Go in a **workflow designed for experienced developers**.

Here’s a **structured roadmap (workflow)** for learning Go effectively:

---

# 🔹 Phase 1: Foundations (1–2 weeks)

👉 Goal: Get comfortable with Go’s syntax and unique philosophy.

1. **Set up environment**

   * Install Go (`go1.23+`)
   * Learn Go module system (`go mod init`, `go get`).
   * IDE setup: VSCode + Go plugin (for `gopls`, linting, debugging).

2. **Language basics** (refreshers for experienced devs)

   * Variables, constants, iota.
   * Data types: `int`, `float`, `bool`, `string`, `struct`, `array`, `slice`, `map`.
   * Pointers (Go has no pointer arithmetic like C).
   * Functions (multiple return values, named returns).

3. **Control flow**

   * `if`, `switch`, `for` (no `while`).
   * Defer, panic, recover (error handling philosophy).

📌 **Deliverable**: Re-implement basic data structures in Go (stack, queue, hashmap) to feel the syntax.

---

# 🔹 Phase 2: Core Go Concepts (2–3 weeks)

👉 Goal: Master what makes Go **different** from Java/Elixir.

1. **Structs & Interfaces**

   * No classes, but structs + interfaces.
   * Interface satisfaction is **implicit** (duck typing).
   * Composition > inheritance.

2. **Concurrency (Go’s superpower)**

   * Goroutines (`go func()`)
   * Channels (sync & async patterns)
   * `select` statement
   * Patterns: worker pools, fan-in, fan-out.

3. **Error handling**

   * Errors as values (`error` interface).
   * `errors.Is` / `errors.As`.
   * Sentinel errors vs wrapping errors.

4. **Packages & project layout**

   * `internal/`, `cmd/`, `pkg/` conventions.
   * Import paths and Go workspace (`go.work`).

📌 **Deliverable**: Build a **concurrent worker pool** that processes jobs with error handling.

---

# 🔹 Phase 3: Applied Backend Development (3–4 weeks)

👉 Goal: Build real backend systems with Go.

1. **Web frameworks**

   * Start with **net/http** (standard lib).
   * Then explore Echo, Fiber, or Gin (similar to Phoenix in Elixir).

2. **Persistence**

   * Database access: `database/sql` + driver (Postgres, MySQL).
   * ORM options: GORM, SQLC (type-safe SQL).
   * Migrations: `golang-migrate`.

3. **Middleware**

   * Authentication, logging, rate limiting.
   * Context usage (`context.Context`) for request-scoped values.

4. **Testing**

   * `testing` package.
   * Table-driven tests.
   * Benchmarks.
   * Mocks with `gomock` or `testify`.

📌 **Deliverable**: Build a small REST API (CRUD + JWT authentication + Postgres).

---

# 🔹 Phase 4: Advanced Go (4–6 weeks)

👉 Goal: Deep dive into performance, scaling, and production practices.

1. **Concurrency patterns**

   * Pipelines.
   * Context cancellation.
   * Errgroup for error-aware goroutines.

2. **Performance optimization**

   * Profiling with `pprof`.
   * Memory optimization.
   * Understanding goroutine scheduling (M\:N model).

3. **Production-grade engineering**

   * Logging (`zerolog`, `zap`).
   * Configuration management (Viper).
   * Dependency injection (Uber Fx or Google Wire).

4. **Go in cloud/microservices**

   * gRPC (Protobufs).
   * REST + OpenAPI.
   * Message queues (Kafka, NATS, RabbitMQ).
   * Dockerize Go apps.

📌 **Deliverable**: Build a microservice that:

* Exposes a gRPC API.
* Connects to Kafka or RabbitMQ.
* Uses Postgres.
* Is fully containerized with Docker Compose.

---

# 🔹 Phase 5: Expert Level (Ongoing)

👉 Goal: Contribute to Go ecosystem & master system-level knowledge.

1. **Internals**

   * How goroutines are scheduled.
   * Memory model (escape analysis, GC).
   * Comparing Go vs JVM & BEAM (important for you since you know Java + Elixir).

2. **Open-source contribution**

   * Contribute to a Go project (e.g., Fiber, Kubernetes, Docker).

3. **System design with Go**

   * Distributed systems.
   * Consistency vs availability (CAP).
   * Building resilient services with Go.

📌 **Deliverable**: Contribute a PR to an open-source Go project.

---

# 🔹 Learning Resources

* 📘 **Books**:

  * *The Go Programming Language* — Donovan & Kernighan.
  * *Concurrency in Go* — Katherine Cox-Buday.

* 🎥 **Courses**:

  * Go by Example (free).
  * Gophercises (hands-on).

* 🛠 **Practice**:

  * LeetCode / Exercism Go track.
  * Build toy projects (CLI tool, API server, scraper).

✅ **Summary Workflow**

1. **Foundations** → syntax, data types, error handling.
2. **Core Go concepts** → concurrency, interfaces, project layout.
3. **Backend development** → REST APIs, DB, testing.
4. **Advanced Go** → performance, gRPC, microservices, cloud.
5. **Expert level** → internals, open-source, distributed systems.

⚡ Since you’re coming from **Elixir (actor model, concurrency)** and **Java (OOP, enterprise systems)**, I’d recommend spending **extra focus on Go’s concurrency model (goroutines + channels)** and **interface-based design** (very different from Java’s OOP).
